unreasonable to accept the conclusion based solely on the premises\n\n\nAn inductively strong arg with all true premises is called an inductively cogent (有说服力的) arg.\n\n\nSummary\n\nDeductive arg is either decutively valid or invalid\n\nIf it's valid, it is either sound or unsound\n\n\nInducitve arg is either strong or weak\n\nIf it's strong, it is either cogent or not cogent\n\n\nIn a deducitvely valid arg, the information of the conclusion is contained in the information of the premises.\n\nIn an inductively strong arg, the information of the conclusion goes beyond the information of the premises\n\nsometiemes called ampliative (扩充的) arg\n\n\n\nRemark \n\nA deductive arg may contain premises that make probability claims yet still be a deductive arg.\n\nIt's not the content of the premises but the way they're related to one another (thier structure), the kind of inference they make\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nvalid - strcuture, although one premise is false\n\nnot sound\n\nthe conclusion is contained in the information of premises, the truth of the premises is already guarantee the truth of conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\ninvalid - the strcuture is prbolematic\n\nit's deducitve because the premises and conclusion are structured in a way that the premises are intended to fully support the conclsuion\nthe premises are true but the conclusion is false\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional Claims\n\na type of complex claim in whic the truth of one claim (the consequent -  后件, 推断), somehow depends upon or is contigent upon the truth of another claim (the antecendent - 前件)\n\noften articulated in the form \"if p, then q\"\n\np and q can themselves be either simple or complex claims\n\nIn the common, \"if p, then q\" form, p is the antecedent and q is the consequent\n\n\n\n\nIn the minimal sort of relationship between antecedent and consequent, a conditional claim asserts simply that when the antecedent is true the consequent is also true\n\nA conditional is false when its antecedent is true and its consequent false; otherwise, it is true\n\nRemark \n\nsimply by being conditional claims, do not imply any particular type of relationship btw. the antecedent and consequent, causal of toherwise - and so neither do statements of ncessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nConditional Claims in Deduction\n\nThe relationship btw. the premises and the conclusion of a deductively valid arg may be expressed thoruhg a coditional claim.\n\noften describe this relationship: \"If the premises are true, then the conclusion is true\"\n\n\nValid deductive arg are conditional claims where the antecedent (the premies) is connected to the consequence (the conclusion) in a particular, logical way called entailment (something that is inferred)\n\nA unique and important feature of conditional statements is that they only proceed in one direction\n\ncan't run the inference in the other direction once the direction is detemrined (not always p to q)\n\"if p, then q\", the truth of q follows from the truth of p, but the truth of p does not follow from the truth of q\n\n\n\nNecessary Conditions\n\nnecessary condition is a state of affairs that must occur for another state of affairs to occur\n\noften indicated by the \"only if\"\n\ne.g \"We'll go to the movies if you clean your rooms\" and \"We'll go to the movies only ifyou clean your rooms\". \n1st instance, there might be other conditions under which the family goes to the movies (snow or rain, persuasion, etc.)\n2nd instance, \"only if\" establishes an exclusive condition that must be met, without which ( {% math %}/leftarrow{% endmath %} the exclusive condition) the antecedent won't be true\n\n\nThe component statement designated by the phrase “only if ” is the necessary condition of a conditional claim \n\n\nRemark\n\n'if' is the sign of the antecedent; 'only if' is the sign of the consequent ?\n\nExample\nthe presesnce of breathable oxygen is a necessary condition for humans to live, which means humans must have breathable oxygen in order to live.\nWritten in terms of \"if p, then q\" - \"If humans are living, then breathable oxygen is present.\"\nTherefore:\n- The consequent of an \"if... then...\" statement is the necessary condition for the antecedent\nRemark \n\n\"if p, then q,\" the truth of p is claimed to correlate with the truth of q\n\na true p is claimed to imply that q is also true\n\n\nrefer to the example, the presence of breathable oxygen does not reuslt in humans living (need more than oxygen to live)\n\nthe presence of breathable oxygen alone is not enough to know that humans can live\n\n\n\nSufficient Condition\n\na condition that when met is enough to know that some other condition has also been met.\n\nThe antecedent of an “if…then…” statement is the sufficient condition for the consequent\n\n\nRemark \n\ne.g: A black mail who says, \"I'll not go to the police with the incriminating information I have about you only if you give me the money\"\n\nthis has not said that giving him the money will result in his not informing the police\nhe has not said, strictly speaking, what will happen if the money is paid\nthe blackmailer has made the much more limited claim that if the moeny is not paid he will inform the police\npaying the blackmailer is necessary for his not going to the plice, but it's not suffcient to guarantee it\n\n\n\nBiconditional Claims\n\nA biconditional claim is a complex claim that expresses a relationsip of equivalence btw. two claims. \n\nTwo claims are considered equivalent in this logical sense, when they always have the saem truth value (both true or both false)\n\n\n\nExample\n\"Suzy will get a raise if and only if she gets a promotion\"\n\n\"if and only if\" -  denote the biconditional relationship btw. Suzy's getting a raise and Suzy's getting a promotion.\n\nClassifying and Comparing Claims\nComparing Claims\n\nConsistency\n\nabout things fitting together in a way that makes sense\n\nIn logical terms, consistency is a term used to describe a set of claims that can all be true at the same time\n\nInconsistency, occurs within a set of claims when it is not possible for all of the claims to be true at the same time. \n\n\nContradiction (inconsistent)\n\nA contradiction occurs btw. two claims when the truth of one necessitates (使成为必需, 迫使) the falsity of another, and the falsity of one necessitates the truth of the other\n\noccur when for logical reasons two claims must have opposite truth values, and so one must alwasys be false while the other is true.\n\nContradictory statements can never have the same truth values at the same time\n\n\n\nContrariety (inconsistent)\n\nContraries are also inconsistent\n\nA relationship btw two claims that occurs when at least one of the claims must be false\n\nimpossible for both claims to be true at the same time\n\nCompare to contradiction, contrariety not allow two claims that are true together but can both be false.\n\n\n\nEquivalence\n\ndescribes a relationship btw. two claims that always have the same truth value.\n\nIf one claim is true and equivalent to another claim, then the other claim must be true as well\n\nIf one claim is false and equivalent to another claim, then the other claim must be false as well\n\n\n\n\nClassifying Single Claims\n\nContingent Statements\n\ncan be either true of false\n\nstaments that possibly true or false\n\nto be contingent, require that it is possible in some circumstances it is true and in some other possible circumstances it is false\n\n\n\nSelf-contradictions\n\nunder all possible circumstances they alwasy posses the same truth value - false\n\nalso always equivalent to one another\n\n\n\n\nClaims and Definitions\nRecall: Claims, are assertions about what is true or false, but they would be vacuous if the words that composed them didn't have specifc meanings\nLexical\n\nUsing one set of words to define anohter word (group of words) is called lexical definition\n\nE.g: pony = a small horse\nStipulative\nPotential problem: dictionaries often simply report on the way a word is commonly used, which can nevertheless be conceptually problematic and can change significantly over time\n\nspecifying a particular meaning for a term\n\na new or more precise meaning for a term is simply stipulated - a stipulative definition \n\nmore precise, more accurate, and often more enduring definitions\n\n\n\nE.g sound = a valid argument with true premises\nOstensive\n\nPointing to an instance of the reference of a term\n\npointing to something that is more complex or impossible to define wihout an instance in experience\n\n\nE.g: That is a bike.
