## Course Introduction

Hardware and lower-level related courses - CMPUT229, 329

Grade mapping - CS and ENG are difference (no curved and formula, using histogram with breakpoint)

Morning Problems - need to pass all the **test case** to get 100% (50% after class), otherwise 0%   

#### Algorithms

One of the key building blocks of **Problem Solving** 

#### Problem Solving

Using: 
- Computational thinking i
  - using problem decomposition - break a larger problem into multiple smaller problems
  - able to use and apply known **algorithms** to solve the problem
- Problem decomposition
- Iterative development
  - build drafts, and iterate the draft (like adding new features, problems, etc.)

#### What is Computer Science

study of computation - define computation and apply in Probelm Solving  
  
- Algorithms - Problem Solving strategies (preceise instructions or operations)
  - apply known algorithms based on different problems and situations
  - concepts of building new algorithms
- Data structures (preceise data specification)
- Computer Programs = algorithms + data strcutures

#### Classifier

- able to receive, process / identify information, and return results.

- ability of learn, can be trained (supervising training) with examples / data / etc.
  - able to process / identify similar information but not in trainning section

#### Empircial Evaluation

A method of evaluating whether if a machine learning system is efficient

#### Big O Notation 

A mathematic way of evaluating the efficency of algorithms
