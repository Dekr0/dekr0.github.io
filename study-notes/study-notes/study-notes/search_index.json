a function that represent a curve or path (line, parabola, etc.)\ncurve / path should cross point (a,b)(a,b)(a,b)\nchoose the curve / path that is relatively simple to approach (a,b)(a,b)(a,b)\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nLet y\ny=kxy = kxy=kx\n\nthen replace yyy in f(x,y)f(x,y)f(x,y) with kxkxkx\nf(x,y)=f(x,kx)=...=k21+k4x2xf(x,y) = f(x,kx) = ... = \\frac {k^2}{1+k^4x^2}xf(x,y)=f(x,kx)=...=​1+k​4​​x​2​​​​k​2​​​​x\n\ncalculate the limit as x approach to 000 \nlimx→0f(x,kx)\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}f(x,kx)​x→0​lim​​f(x,kx) = 0\n\nLet x\nx=y2x = y^2x=y​2​​ \n\nthen\nf(x,y)=f(y2,y)=...=12f(x,y) = f(y^2, y) = ... = \\frac {1}{2}f(x,y)=f(y​2​​,y)=...=​2​​1​​\n\n∵12≠0\\because \\frac {1}{2} \\neq 0∵​2​​1​​≠0 \n\n∴\\therefore∴ Limit D.N.E by definition\n\nExamples (limit do exist)\nGeneral Solution:\n\nuse path approach method to determine whether if the limit exist\nif the limit exist and can be calculated, the limit from calculation is \"supspect limit\"\n\nprove the supspect limit: use either ϵ δ\\epsilon ~ \\deltaϵ δ definition or Squeeze theorm\n\n\nExample 1 :\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\napply Squeeze Th.\ntake a function similared to f(x,y)f(x,y)f(x,y) (omit the x2x^2x​2​​ term in the bottom)\ncompare with the original function\n\n\n\nSide Note:\n\nabs. value of term with even degree is same as the original term\n\n\nContinuity\n\nNotes (not a single cond.):\n\nf(a,b)f(a,b)f(a,b) must exist, that is, (a,b)∈Df(a,b) \\in D_f(a,b)∈D​f​​ (domain)\nlim(x,y)→(a,b)\\lim\\limits_{(x,y) \\to (a,b)}​(x,y)→(a,b)​lim​​ must exist\nIf both exist, they must be equal\n\nExamples\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\nRemark: Polar Coordinates\n\n"}}}
