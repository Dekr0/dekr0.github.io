# Lecture 3

Digital Logic - The basis for all digital systems

Signals - Information contained in a physically measurbale quantity

Digital and Analog

- Digital, current & voltage can assume only discrete values (usually two)

- Signal Processing as Bit unit

- Easy to realize processing using electronics

- Analog, current & voltage can have any value (Continuous)

- No latency, high speed $$\rightarrow$$ High performance

**Moore's Law**

- Chip complexity ~ doubles evry two year

## Number Systems & Conversions

### Switching Circuit
