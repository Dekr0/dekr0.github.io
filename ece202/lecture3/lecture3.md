## Passive Elements

### Resistors

What is the relation between $$I_{AB}$$ and $$V_{AB}$$?

For metallic systems, in general, $$V_{AB}$$ is proportional to $$I_{AB}$$ or $$V_{AB} = R I_{AB}$$

Ohm's Law may not be always valid

###  Miceoaopix origin of resistance

- These ions / atoms are not static. They vibrate about their mean position of rest due to thermal energy

- As $$e^{-}$$ flow inside a metal wire, they lose energy and momentum due to interactions ("collisions") with impurities and the lattice vibrations. This explains the energy loss of the

- This lost energy is transferred to the material $$\rightarrow$$ 	- the material gets hot.

### R Dependent Factors

R depends on the following factors:
- Material property 
	- more electrons $$\rightarrow$$ less resistance; e.g: metal
	- less electrons $$\rightarrow$$ more resistance; e.g: plastic or ceramic
- Dimensions of the material
	- higher volume $$\rightarrow$$ more $$e^{-} \rightarrow$$ less resistance
	- higher volume (adding extra material, also introduce more ions atoms / ions) $$\rightarrow$$ more collisions $$\rightarrow$$ higher resistance
- Temperature (T)
	- The material gets hot $$\rightarrow$$ lattice ions vibrate more $$\rightarrow$$ more collisions with $$e^{-} \rightarrow$$ higher R
	- as T increases, R increases (metallic systems)

Resistivity value is obtained from experiment

### Circuit Model of Resistors

- Circuit model ignores the details of the wire (material, dimensions - cross areas, distance / length between entrance and exist)
	- only mentiosn the "lumped" or "composite" varibale R (lumped Component Approximation, LCA)

- 

-
	- but in te circuit model, resistance is lumped in the ZigZag region
