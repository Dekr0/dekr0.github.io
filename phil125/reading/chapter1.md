# Chapter 1

## Claims

**Foreword** 

- One of the most basic elements of critical thinking (when engaged with issues related to logic and science):

	- discern whether claims are actually true 
	- distinguish them from claims that are not true, most likely seem true, or are best judged false

- Good critical thinker must develop an acute (敏锐的) grasp (理解, 把握) of language in order to:

	- make clear and preceise claims about the truth
	- assess the quality the claims function in the logic of an argumnent

- One of first judgements a good critical thinker must make
	- determine in **what way** a statement is **presented** (how)

**Definition** 

- Claims are statements that **indicate a position** has been taken.
	- a statement or proposition that in some meaningful sense **sincerely belongs to** whomever or whatever **asserts** it

- Sometimes a conclusion of an argument or a premises of an argument can be called a claim

### Statement (Propositions (提议, 命题))

e.g can simply be sentences that can be either true of false

**Remark** :

- **Bivalence**. 
	- Statements or propositions can **only** have **one truth value**, it must only be either true or false
	- Statements or proposition can't be both true and false in the **same sense** under the **same circumstances** 

- **Excluded middle** 
	- **No middle groud** o **gray area** between truth values in basic logic
	- Statements or proposition can't be "sort of true" and "sort of false"

- **Non-statements and Propositions**
	- Sentences that are not statements or propositions simply do not have truth value (e.g. "Where are you going?", "Stop that!", etc.)


### Beliefs and Opinions

#### example of **claim** and **opinion**

- claim - "The world is around"
- opinion - "Pele was a better athlete than Gretzky" (a claim is deflated (缩小) to a opinion)

#### Misleading (Misunderstanding) of Claims and Opinions

- **Beliefs** can often be **either true** or **false**

- **Opinions** are not really **true** or **false** 
	- mistaken view: be free from the same scrutiny (细看) and justification required by claims to *know*
		- reuslts: one's opinions are somehow insulated (免受影响) form disupte or challengei
	- stand aloned in people thought (disconnected from criticism and critical thinking) **but** are sitll very much claims (true or false) open to criticism in reality

	- **influenced by what people value**

- **Keep in mind**: opinions often **incorporate** judgments and emotions about what is valuable 
	- either subjectively, to the person expressing the opinion, 
	- or objectively, to everyone in the world

### Simple and Complex Claims

- **Simple Claim** 
	- logically speaking, is not **divisible** into other, more basic claims
	- **usually** is a **single subject-predicate formula** 
		- e.g: "It's a cat", "That ball is round"

- **Complex Claim**
	- logically composed of **two or more** claims (or, minimally, a single claim that's negated (否定)) connected by speical words or ideas (*logical operators* / *connectives*)

- **Negation** 
	- e.x. "University of Alberta is in Edmonton. University of Alberta is not in Edmonton."

Analogy:
- Simple claims, atoms
- Complex claims, molecules

Be careful, when saying argree with a complex claims, that means saying argree with the entire complex claims, not only parts of the complex claims.

#### Example

"Earth exists" $$\rightarrow$$ Simple

"Earth exists, and humans live on it" $$\rightarrow$$ Complex (claim "Humans live on Earth" is added)

Notice that a complex claim may be expressed in lots of way, and yet still be composed of the same simple claims

### Truth Conditions

- Truth conditions of simple statements
	- Circumstances which make a statment true
- Truth conditions of compound statements
	- In the case of truth-functional compounds, is **determined fully** by the truth conditions of the components 

#### Example

- Simple claim: Ben is a singer. 
	- Suppose Ben is not a singer, then therefore, claims "Ben is a singer" is false and claims "Ben is not a singer" is true.

## Arguments

- a **special tool** that systematically **collects** and **arranges** reasons in support of the truth of a claim
	- arguments are **sets of claims** in which one or more claims are provide support or justification or proof for the truth of **another claim** 
	- an arg's a collected series **statements** to establish a definition **proposition**

- essential componeents ($$>2$$)
	- a single *conclusion*
	- at least one reason or premise (假定) for the conclusion to **be true**
		- premises are intended somehow to support 
		- or seem to support a conclusion indicates that a third element is present in logical argument
	- an *inference* (推理) from the premise(s) to the conclusion
		- quality of he inference

#### Examples:

- "Racial segregation reduces some persons to the status of things. Hence, segregation is morally wrong."
	- claim (conclusion) of this argument is "segregation is morally wrong
	- premise is "Racial segregation reduce..."
	- there is no inference from premise to claim, explain why the conclusion follows from that premise (relationship between premise and claim)

### Logic, Eristics (争论)

Commonly, the term "argument" refers only to a dispute btw. two or more people, any kind of dispute.

- Eristics - the study of winning disputes

- Logic - the study of reasoning

Arugments, in the technica, logical sense discussed here do not require a dispute, dissagreement, or even dialogue (certainly no yelling or any other sort)

Debates include argument but it needn't have a debate to argue

### Arguments, Explanations

Not all sets of sentences that lead to statements claimed to be true are arguments.

- Explanations are sets of claims that function to establish *how* or *why* something is the case

- Arguments undertake to establish that some claim, normally a claim in question, is actually true

*Arguments show that something is the case* 

*Explanations show how or why something is the case*

## Premises

Argument depends for its strength upon *premises* functioning as reasons to accpet the conclusion
	- give an argument its heft (重要性), its strength,, the ground upon which the conclusion stands
	- work togther in exacting ways to prove or demonstrate or justify the conclusion

### Emthymemes

Premises that is implicit or unspoken, usually probable (很大可能) claims already accepted by the auidence

They are informal argument that rely on premises not explicitly articulated

### Identifying premises

Easier if first identifying the argument's conclusion.
	- Once the conclusion is identified, any remaining claims that are there to support the truth of the conclusion become easier to discern

**Remark** 

- not necessarily the case that all of the claims in anyu given text are usde as premises

- complex claims -  whether or not should be untangled and broken up, might change its meaning

#### Example

- some claims merely elaborate, highlight, clarify, or give examples in realtion to one of the premises

- sentences for rhetorical purposes

- sentences are not relevant to the logic of the arg., though they may be used to clarify or explain a claim or a term, or they may be used to make th arg. flow moer smoothly

## Conclusions

- The conclusion of an argument is the claim that **the premises** are to support or justify

- The conclusion is the main point of the arg. (Analogy: arg = treasure hunt, conclusion = treasure, premises = directions presented to the destination of the treasure)

- Every argument has one an **only** one conclusion

- All important points should work together to support one single claim.

### Arg. Structure

- possible claim to draw multiple conclusions from args.
	- sometimes that means that subconclusions are drawn on the way to a final conclusion

- possible that the preimises of the arg support the truth of multiple claims or a complex claim that can be broken into multiple claims

- when multiple conclusions can be drawn from **a single set of premises**, it's best to think of **each conclusion** as **the result of a single arg**.

### Simple and Complex Args

- Each argument has a single conclusion. If a claim is supported by some premises, and that claim functions as a premise for another conclusion, we have a complex arg.
