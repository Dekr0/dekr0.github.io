# Chapter 1

## Claims

**Foreword** 

- One of the most basic elements of critical thinking (when engaged with issues related to logic and science):

	- discern whether claims are actually true 
	- distinguish them from claims that are not true, most likely seem true, or are best judged false

- Good critical thinker must develop an acute (敏锐的) grasp (理解, 把握) of language in order to:

	- make clear and preceise claims about the truth
	- assess the quality the claims function in the logic of an argumnent

- One of first judgements a good critical thinker must make
	- determine in **what way** a statement is **presented** (how)

**Definition** 

- Claims are statements that **indicate a position** has been taken.
	- a statement or proposition that in some meaningful sense **sincerely belongs to** whomever or whatever **asserts** it

### Statement (Propositions (提议, 命题))

e.g can simply be sentences that can be either truee of false

**Remark** :

- **Bivalence**. 
	- Statements or propositions can **only** have **one truth value**, it must only be either true or false
	- Statements or proposition can't be both true and false in the **same sense** under the **same circumstances** 

- **Excluded middle** 
	- **No middle groud** o **gray area** between truth values in basic logic
	- Statements or proposition can't be "sort of true" and "sort of false"

- **Non-statements and Propositions**
	- Sentences that are not statements or propositions simply do not have truth value (e.g. "Where are you going?", "Stop that!", etc.)

### Beliefs and Opinions

#### example of **claim** and **opinion**

- claim - "The world is around"
- opinion - "Pele was a better athlete than Gretzky" (a claim is deflated (缩小) to a opinion)

#### Misleading (Misunderstanding) of Claims and Opinions

- **Beliefs** can often be **either true** or **false**

- **Opinions** are not really **true** or **false** 
	- mistaken view: be free from the same scrutiny (细看) and justification required by claims to *know*
		- reuslts: one's opinions are somehow insulated (免受影响) form disupte or challengei
	- stand aloned in people thought (disconnected from criticism and critical thinking) **but** are sitll very much claims (true or false) open to criticism in reality

	- **influenced by what people value**

- **Keep in mind**: opinions often **incorporate** judgments and emotions about what is valuable 
	- either subjectively, to the person expressing the opinion, 
	- or objectively, to everyone in the world

### Simple and Complex Claims

- **Simple Claim** 
	- logically speaking, is not **divisible** into other, more basic claims
	- **usually** is a **single subject-predicate formula** 
		- e.g: "It's a cat", "That ball is round"

- **Complex Claim**
	- logically
